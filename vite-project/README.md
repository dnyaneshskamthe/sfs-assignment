# React App with Vite

Welcome to the React app built using Vite! This project serves as a quick template for setting up a React application with Vite, providing you with a starting point to develop your web application. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dnyaneshskamthe/sfs-assignment.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the development server and open your app in your default web browser.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **src**: This directory contains all the source code for your React application.
  - **components**: Store your React components in this directory.
  - **App.jsx**: The main application component.
  - **main.jsx**: The entry point of your application.

## Features

- **Sign-In Functionality**: The landing page is loaded with sign-in functionality. Users can sign in using their credentials.

- **Registration**: Users have the option to register if they are not already signed in. You can implement the registration feature by creating a registration page and integrating it with your authentication system.

- **Forgot Password**: Note that the "Forgot Password" functionality is not implemented in this template. You can add this feature by creating a "Forgot Password" page and implementing the necessary logic to reset passwords.
